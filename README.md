Solutions for programming problems (Competitive programming) using cpp and Java

I've been working on the problem set of Codeforces and Uva online judge (Some of the easy and medium problems by now). 
I consider there is still a lot of techniques and concepts that I can learn having in mind Felix and Steven Hamlim's book 
(Competitive programming 3) as a guide which I consider a very well written and an eye-opener book for programmers

I hope you can get some new insights on problems that you probably worked before if that is your case. Any suggestion, comment that 
you consider will improve the solutions or the way I approach problem solving here is very welcomed!

Regards, 
Miguel
